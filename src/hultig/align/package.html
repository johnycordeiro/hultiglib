        This package gathers the sequence alignment algorithms used in other
        classes, specially those in the <code>hultig.sumo</code> package. Two
        sequence alignment algorithms were adapted for word alignment between
        sentence pairs. One for global alignment - The <i>Needleman Wunsch</i>
        - and another for local alignment - The <i>Smith Waterman</i>.
